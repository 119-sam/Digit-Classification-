# Digit Classification using Neural Networks

## üìå Project Overview
This project implements a **Neural Network-based digit classifier** using the **MNIST dataset**. The model is trained to recognize handwritten digits (0-9) with **high accuracy (97%)**, leveraging **deep learning techniques**.

---

##  Dataset Details
The dataset used is **MNIST**, which consists of **grayscale handwritten digits** widely used in image classification.

- **Training Samples:** 60,000  
- **Test Samples:** 10,000  
- **Image Size:** 28x28 pixels  
- **Number of Classes:** 10 (digits 0-9)  
- **Dataset Source:** [Keras MNIST Dataset](https://keras.io/api/datasets/mnist/)

---

##  Data Preprocessing
The following preprocessing steps were applied before training:

‚úî **Normalization:** Pixel values scaled to **[0,1]** for better convergence.  
‚úî **Reshaping:** Converted dataset into **flat vectors** for input processing.  
‚úî **One-Hot Encoding (Manhattan Coding):** Class labels transformed into categorical vectors.

##   Model Architecture
The **Neural Network** consists of multiple layers optimized for digit classification.

- **Input Layer:** `100 neurons`
- **Hidden Layers:** `10 fully connected layers` (each with `100 neurons`)
- **Activation Functions:**
  - `ReLU` for hidden layers (introduces non-linearity)
  - `Sigmoid` for the output layer (predicts class probabilities)
- **Loss Function:** `Categorical Cross-Entropy`
- **Optimizer:** `Adam`

##  Model Performance
- **Accuracy Achieved:** `97%` on the test dataset  
- **Loss Function Optimization:** Effectively minimized using **Categorical Cross-Entropy**
